# Permissions

Time cockpit has a fully configurable and extensible permission management system. In the standard configuration of time cockpit, the permission management system is based on assigning roles to users. 

Time cockpit is delivered with two predefined roles, ```Admin``` and ```User```. Based on these two roles, permissions are defined in the time cockpit default configuration. All users are assigned to the ```User``` role when they are created via the website (www.timecockpit.com). Depending on whether a user was given the ```Admin``` role during the creation on the website, a user is also assigned the ```Admin``` role in time cockpit. Administrators have the right to use the customization module in time cockpit, edit the data model, issue queries, and to run IronPython scripts. Administrators may also create roles and assign roles to other users.

## Entities for Permission Management

In the standard data model of time cockpit, the role concept is implemented with three entities. ```APP_UserDetail``` contains the information about a user. ```APP_UserRole``` contains the various roles supported by time cockpit (in standard ```Admin``` and ```User```). ```APP_UserDetailRole``` contains the assignment of a user to different roles. Time cockpit allows a user to be assigned to multiple roles.

> [!WARNING]
It is not recommended to set restrictive permissions on the entity ```APP_UserDetail```. It must be possible for the application to store its own user entry at any time. This is because the user's language is stored in the user entry. A user can change his / her language and must always be able to store his / her own user entry. Incorrect permissions can cause time cockpit to stop working. If you are not sure about permissions on the ```APP_UserDetail``` entity, contact support@timecockpit.com. In terms of permissions we recommend **KISS** - Keep it small and simple!

## Manage Roles

Since roles are just conventional records like e.g. a project, a time sheet entry or a customer, they can also be created using the ```New item``` button. Only users in the ```Admin``` can create new roles. A role has 3 properties.

* Code: The code of the role. The code be short and **must** be unique.
* Name: The name of the role. This serves for easier identification of the role.
* Description: An optional more elaborate description of the role.

In the ```Users``` module in the section "Rolemanagement" you will find the list ```Roles``` where roles can be added, edited and removed. In addition, time cockpit provides a list ```Assign roles```. In this list, user-to-role assignments can be created.

## Creating Permissions

Like validation rules, calculated properties, or default values for properties, TCQL expressions are also used for permissions. In contrast to validation rules, etc., there is an additional keyword to ```Current``` in permission expressions - ```Environment```. ```Environment``` gives a user access to global and user-specific properties. 
* Environment.CurrentUser: The user who is currently logged on to the system. ```Environment.CurrentUser``` is the record from the entity APP_UserDetail that corresponds to the currently logged on user.
* Environment.GlobalSettings: Gives access to the system wide settings that are not dependent on a given user.

The following code snippet shows a simple permission for a user. An action in time cockpit should only be executed by a user in the ```Admin``` role. To implement this permissiom, a ```SetCurrentUserRoles```, which is included in the standard data model, is used (see [Sets](~/doc/scripting/sets.md)). ```CurrentUserRoles``` always returns the roles of a logged-in user. To illustrate the definition of the set:

```
From R In APP_UserDetailRole 
Where R.UserDetail.UserDetailUuid = Environment.CurrentUser.UserDetailUuid 
Select New With 
{ 
  R.UserRole.Code 
}
```

Using the set ```CurrentUserRoles```, you can create permissions to check whether the currently logged-on user is assigned to a specific role. The following permission definition checks whether a user is assigned to the role ```Admin```. ```Set('CurrentUserRoles', 'Code')``` returns the result of the ```CurrentUserRoles``` set for the logged-on user. The result of the set is a list of role codes. The permission checks whether the list of a user's role codes contains the value ```Admin```.

```
'Admin' In Set('CurrentUserRoles', 'Code')
```

> [!NOTE]
Due to the fact that ```CurrentUserRoles``` is configured as a **logon set**, the application must be restarted after changes to the role assignments. Logon sets are executed **only** once at the application startup and remain unchanged during the runtime of the application!

## Types of Permissions

Time cockpit allows users to assign permissions to different elements of the data model. In the following, all elements that can be permissionized are described. The various types of permissions are described using a concrete scenario. For the scenario, the following requirements should be fulfilled:

1. Only users with the role ```Projectadmin``` should be able to create projects
1. Users can only track time on projects which they are assigned to
1. Only users who are in the ```Projectadmin``` role are allowed to see the ```Projectbudget``` property
1. The ```budgetary control of projects``` list should only be available to users with the role ```Evaluator```
1. The ```Complete project``` action should only be executed by a ```Projectadmin```

A new role ```Projectadmin``` and a new set ```MyProjects``` is created as a prerequisite for the requirements. The ```Projectadmin``` role should be assigned to a user.

![Create Project Admin Role](images/create-project-admin-role-web.png "Create Project Admin Role")

![Assign Project Admin](images/assign-project-admin-web.png "Assign Project Admin")

To implement the ```MyProjects``` set, a multiple assignment between a user (```APP_UserDetail```) and a project (```APP_Project```) must be created (see [M: N relationships for the implementation of multiple assignments](~/doc/data-model-customization/entity.md)). The definition of the ```MyProjects``` set is as follows:

```
From P In UserDetailProject 
Where P.UserDetail.UserDetailUuid = Environment.CurrentUser.UserDetailUuid 
Select New With
{
  P.Project.Code
}
```

The set is defined as a **logon** set and returns all projects that are assigned to the user currently logged on.

## Permissions on Entities (Row-Level Permissions)

Permissions on entities are row-level permissions, because e.g. a project record is represented by one single row in the database. Entity permissions ensure that records of an entity (e.g. Project) can not be read or edited. In our example, requirement (1) would be a candidate for an entity permission. Project records can only be created by users assigned to the ```Projectadmin``` role.

## Requirement 1

A write permission for an entity can be added customization module under ```Edit entity -> Permissions```. In principle, permissions for entities and for properties / relationships are created using the same mechanism. Whether a permission is defined for an entity is defined in the ```New permission``` form. When adding a new permission, you can also select either the entity itself or properties and relationships. If you select the entity name in the combo box, a permission is created for the entity (in this example Project). If you select a property or relationship, a permission that only applies to the property / relationship in question is created. Since an entity permission is required for requirement (1), the entity name (```APP_Project```) is selected.

![Entity vs Property Permission](images/entity-vs-property-permission-web.png "Entity vs Property Permission")

Like a validation rule, a permission has a ```Name```, an ```Error message```, and a ```Condition``` that determines whether or not a user has permission. In addition, a permission has a ```Type``` property that specifies whether the permission is a read or write permission.

![Permission Condition](images/permission-condition.png "Permission Condition")

To ensure that only users assigned to the ```Projectadmin``` role are allowed to create projects, ```WriteProject``` is defined with the condition ```'PA' In Set ('CurrentUserRoles', 'Code')```. This permission ensures that only users in the ```Projectadmin``` role can create projects. **Users who do not have the ```Projectadmin``` role thus have only read access on project records.**

![Read-only Project Form](images/read-only-project-form-web.png "Read-only Project Form")

> [!NOTE]
If you wanted to remove the write permissions for an element for all users, an expression which is always false (for example, ```1 = 0```) must be entered as a condition. The current version of the TCQL expression language does not support that you enter ```False``` as condition.

## Requirement 2

To meet the requirement that users can only read the projects assigned to them, it is necessary to define a read permission for the entity project. To do this, a permission is defined based on the ```MyProjects``` set.

![Read Project Permission](images/read-project-permission-web.png "Read Project Permission")

The read permission ```Current.Code In Set ('MyProjects') Or 'PA' Set ('CurrentUserRoles')``` checks whether a project record is assigned to a user or whether a user is ```Projectadmin```. If so, the record is displayed in the project list of a user. As can be seen in the following figure, only those projects that are assigned to the logged-on user are displayed in the selection combo box of the projects when creating a time sheet entry. This means that when the read permission ```ReadProject``` is enabled, only projects are displayed in the user interface which are assigned to the logged-on user.

![Read Only Assigned Projects](images/read-only-assinged-projects-web.png "Read Only Assigned Projects")

<!-- ## Permissions on Properties and Relations

A write permission for a property and relation is added or edited in the customization module under ```Edit entity -> Permissions```. Basically, permissions for properties / relations and for entities are created using the same mechanism. Whether a permission is defined for a property / relations is defined in the ```New permission``` form. As can be seen in the following figure, you can also select properties and relations and the _entity name_ in the permissions combo box. If you select the name of a property / relation in the combo box a permission is created for the property / relations.

![Read Permission On Budget](images/read-permission-on-budget.png "Read Permission On Budget") -->

<!-- ## Requirement 3

For requirement 3, it is necessary to define an permission for the ```Budget``` property on the entity ```APP_Project```. The budget property should only be read by users who are assigned to the ```Projectadmin``` role. This requirement is implemented by the permission expression ```'PA' In Set ('CurrentUserRoles', 'Code')```. This condition states that the budget of a project is readable only if the logged-on user has the ```Projectadmin``` role. This applies to both custom lists and forms.

The following figure shows two project lists. The left project list has been opened with ```Projectadmin``` permission, and the right project list with the permissions of a conventional user. Budget is displayed in the project list of the user in the ```Projectadmin``` role. Budget is not displayed in the right list without the ```Projectadmin``` role. In addition, the figure shows input form of a project that was opened without ```Projectadmin``` role. Budget is not visible in the form.

> [!NOTE]
At this point, the definition of a permission for a property is demostrated. Permissions on relations are the same in many respects, so they are not addressed separately in this document. -->
