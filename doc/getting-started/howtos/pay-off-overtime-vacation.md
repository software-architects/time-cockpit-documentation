# Pay Off Overtime/Vacation

## How to Pay Of Overtime
To pay of overtime you have to insert a new overtime correction. When you insert a new overtime correction you have to fill the fields:

| Field          | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User           | the employee who gets overtime payed out                            |
| Effective Date | the desired date (beginning of the day) for the overtime correction |
| Overtime       | desired amount of hours of overtime to the effective date           |

#### Example
Tim Smith has 44h overtime to the end of April 2017 and he wants to get payed out 24 hours to that time. Therefore you have to create an overtime correction with an effecitve date of 2017-05-01 and a value for overtime of 20h (44-24).


## How to Pay Of Vacation
To pay of vacation you have to insert a negative vacation entitlement. When you insert a new vacation entitlement you have to fill the fields:

| Field               | Description                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User                | the employee who gets vacation payed out                             |
| Date of Entitlement | the desired date for the vacation entitlement                        |
| Number of Weeks     | desired amount of weeks to pay out                                   |

#### Example
Tim Smith has 2 weeks vacation to the end of June 2017 and he wants to get payed out these 2 weeks because his employment ends with June 2017. In this case you have to crate a vacation entitlement with a 'Number of Weeks' of -2 and a 'Date of Entitlement' of 2017-06-30.
