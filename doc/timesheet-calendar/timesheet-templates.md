# Time Sheet Templates

Time sheet templates in time cockpit are a powerful feature designed to streamline your time tracking process, making it more efficient and consistent. These templates are preconfigured time entries that you can quickly apply to your time sheets. By using time sheet templates, you eliminate the need to manually input the same information repeatedly. Simply select the appropriate template and apply it to your time sheet.

### Create a Time Sheet Template

Time sheet templates in Time Cockpit allow you to simplify the process of tracking recurring tasks and activities. You can create templates for common tasks and easily apply them to your time sheets. Here's how to create and use time sheet templates:

1. **Create a Time Sheet Entry**: Start by adding a new time sheet entry for the task or activity you want to turn into a template. Fill in all the relevant information, such as description, duration, and other details, and then click "Save."

2. **Save as Template**: Right-click the time sheet entry you've created and select "Save as template."

3. **Name Your Template**: Provide a name for your template and save it.

4. **Access Your Template**: Your newly created template will be available in the "Timesheet Template" section on the left side of time cockpit.

### Edit a Time Sheet Template

Time sheet templates are highly flexible and can be adjusted as your projects and tasks evolve. You can easily modify their descriptions, durations, or any other template details. Here's how to edit a time sheet template:

1. **Access Template**: On the left side of time cockpit, right-click the template you wish to modify and select "Edit template."

2. **Make Changes**: A time sheet entry form will open, allowing you to make any necessary changes to the template details.

3. **Save Your Template**: After making your edits, click "Save template."

>[!NOTE]
If the time sheet form contains validation errors and doesn't meet the criteria of a valid time sheet entry (for instance, if you've left out mandatory information), you can still save the template. Time cockpit will prompt you to complete the missing mandatory fields when you use the template. On the other hand, if you've created a valid template, time cockpit will save the time sheet entry directly without opening a dialog.

## Drag and Drop
Time sheet templates can be easily applied through drag and drop. Simply drag a template into the time sheet calendar or drop it on the signal bar or an Outlook appointment.

**Snap to Signal Bars:** 
When you drag a time sheet template onto a signal bar, it will automatically snap to match the signal bar's duration. This simplifies the process of creating time entries based on predefined templates, ensuring they align seamlessly with your signals.

**Snap to Outlook Appointment:** 
When you drag a template onto an Outlook appointment, you have precise control over the result:

  - Placing the template over the **left side** of the Outlook appointment retains the description and duration from the template.
  - If you position the template over the **right side** of the appointment, it will inherit the description, location, and duration of the underlying Outlook appointment.
