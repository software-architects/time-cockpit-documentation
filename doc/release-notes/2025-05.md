- **Default Permissions**
  Introduced predefined default roles to give organizations more granular control over user permissions in Time Cockpit. 👉 [Learn more](~/doc/employee-time-tracking/default-permissions.html) and also take a look at our [Migration Guide](~/doc/migration-guides/default-permissions.html).

- **Working Time Limits for Weekly Hours**  
  Working time limits can now be defined not only globally in the system settings but also on a per-user basis via their weekly hours of work.  
  This enables historic and user-specific configurations that can vary across different time periods.

## 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Grid Selection with Virtualization**  
  Resolved an issue where selecting items in a grid did not function correctly when virtualization was enabled.

- **Display of Week Number in Groupings**

  A bug in the display of the week number after grouping by week has been fixed. Previously, "ww" was displayed instead of the correct week number. With the latest update, the week number is now correctly shown in the grouping.

- **FilterValue in RelationCell**

  A bug has been fixed where, under certain conditions, a selected item in a **RelationCell** was not passed correctly when a **FilterValue** was applied. With this update, the selected item is now reliably transferred, even when filtering is active.

- **Switching Between Report Views in Lists**

  An issue has been resolved where switching between report views in a list did not work correctly. If you switched from the **list view** to **Report-A**, then to **Report-B**, and finally back to **Report-A**, the last switch would not execute properly. This behavior has been fixed, and the transitions now work as expected.
