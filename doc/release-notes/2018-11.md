## Web Client

### Generate Reports in Actions
The web client now supports the generation of [SSRS reports](https://www.timecockpit.com/blog/2014/03/31/Custom-Reporting-in-Time-Cockpit-is-Final) from within an action. Up to now, only the Full Client was able to generate a report with an action. This was because the action was able to save the result of the report generation on a users hard disk.

The web client uses a different approach. It temporarily saves a generated report to an [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) from where a user can download the report afterwards. The following example how to return a generated report in a time cockpit action

```python
clr.AddReference("System")
clr.AddReference("System.IO")
clr.AddReference("System.Text.Encoding")
clr.AddReference("TimeCockpit.Windows.Controls")
from System.Text import Encoding
from System.Collections.Generic import List, Dictionary, IEnumerable
from TimeCockpit.Data.QueryLanguage import QueryParameter
from TimeCockpit.Windows.Controls import ReportFormat
from TimeCockpit.Windows.Controls.Reporting import ReportBuilder, ReportConfiguration

def actionSample(actionContext):
	dataContext = actionContext.DataContext
	parameters = List[QueryParameter]()
	configuration = ReportConfiguration()
	data = Dictionary[String, IEnumerable[EntityObject]]()
	
	customerQuery = '''From Current In APP_Customer
	        Order By Current.APP_Code 
	        Select New With
	        {
	            .ObjectUuid = Current.APP_CustomerUuid,
	            Current.APP_Country,
	            Current.APP_Code,
	            Current.APP_CompanyName,
	            Current.APP_Phone,
	            Current.APP_Street,
	            Current.APP_ZipCode,
	            Current.APP_Town
	        }'''
	customers = dataContext.Select(customerQuery)
	data.Add("Customers", customers)
	
	userQuery = '''From U In APP_UserDetail Where U.APP_UserDetailUuid = @UserDetailUuid Select New With { U.Firstname, U.Lastname }'''
	users = dataContext.SelectWithParams({ "Query": userQuery, "@UserDetailUuid": dataContext.Environment.CurrentUser.UserDetailUuid })
	data.Add("User", users)
	        
	reportDefinition = # load report definition from e.g. EntityViewReport table
	        
	reportBuilder = ReportBuilder(dataContext)
	bytes = reportBuilder.GetReport(
		reportDefinition,
	    ReportFormat.Pdf, 
	    data, 
	    parameters, 
	    configuration)
			
	result = FileActionResult()
	result.ContentType = "text/plain"
	result.Inline = False
	result.FileDownloadName = "customer-report.pdf"
	result.FileContents = bytes
	actionContext.ActionResult = result
```

Basically, the only thing to do is to create an instance of `FileActionResult`, assign the generated report to `result.FileContents` and set the action's `ActionResult`.

This way of creating a report is especially handy if you do not have a time cockpit list to assign a report to.

### Support Multiple Datasets in Reports
Up to now, both the Full Client and the Web Client did support just one dataset per report. With the new version, multiple dataset per report are supported.

```python
configuration = ReportConfiguration()
data = Dictionary[String, IEnumerable[EntityObject]]()
	
customerQuery = # some customer query
customers = dataContext.Select(customerQuery)
data.Add("Customers", customers)

userQuery = # some userdetail query
users = dataContext.SelectWithParams({ "Query": userQuery, "@UserDetailUuid": dataContext.Environment.CurrentUser.UserDetailUuid })
data.Add("User", users)

reportDefinition = # load report definition from e.g. EntityViewReport table

reportBuilder = ReportBuilder(dataContext)
bytes = reportBuilder.GetReport(
	reportDefinition,
    ReportFormat.Pdf, 
    data, 
    parameters, 
    configuration)
```

This is especially helpful if you want to give the data in your report more structure. 

### Performance Improvements in Timesheet Calendar
In previous versions, if you had a lot of time sheet entries in a week, the performance when adding or changing entries decreased, because the whole week was redrawn. Now, the changes in the time scheet calendar are tracked more granularily and only those time sheet entries that have changed are redrawn on the screen.

## Working Time Limits
Starting with 2018/09 a new working time limit for Austria came into effect. d

## Bug Fixes
* DisplayProperty in RelationCell was not used in HTML5 when query is auto generated
* Html encode tooltips in calendar
* Use USR_TimesheetUserDetailSelectionList in HTML5 client
* Error when hitting Strg + Left Mouse Button when Impersonated
* Fixed issue in digest cycle
