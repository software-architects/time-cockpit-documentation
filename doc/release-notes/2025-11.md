# 📅 November 2025

## ✨ Improvements

* **New Absence Calendar**
  A new calendar view provides a clear overview of employee vacations, compensatory time (ZA), and sick leave. It improves visibility and helps teams coordinate more efficiently. https://web-rc.timecockpit.com/app/absence-time-calendar

* **Team Lead Management**
  A new feature allows managing team leads within Time Cockpit.
  Team leads can view both **time data** and **absences** of the employees assigned to their teams.

* **Absence Approval Workflow**
  Introduced a new approval workflow for absences (vacation, compensatory time, sick leave).
  This ensures a standardized and transparent process for all absence requests.

* **Project Roles: Manager and Deputy**
  Added two new fields on projects: **Project Manager** and **Deputy Project Manager**.

  * Project Managers can manage their own projects and tasks.
  * Project Controllers can manage all projects and tasks across the organization.

* **Share Timesheet Feature**
  Employees can now **share their time bookings** with other colleagues.
  This improves collaboration and transparency in teams working on shared tasks.
