### Improvements for Mobile Devices

We've been listening to your feedback, and so we've made significant improvements to the mobile experience of time cockpit, making it much more user-friendly on devices like tablets and phones. You can now easily access and interact with the time sheet calendar on the go. We've also improved the handling of time cockpit lists. Stay tuned for more improvements.

### Formatting Profiles in the Web Client

With the latest updates to time cockpit, we've migrated a convenient feature from the full client that allows you to configure formatting profiles directly within the web client. Now, you have the flexibility to fine-tune your formatting preferences for a more personalized and efficient experience. Read more in the [docs](~/doc/timesheet-calendar/formatting-profiles.md).

### Timesheet Template Improvements

we have improved the usage of time sheet templates drag&drop. you can now drag a template on a signal bar and the template will automatically snap to the signal bar duration. also, you can drag a template on an outlook appointment. if you place it over the left side of the outlook appointment, the resulting time cockpit will keep its description and duration. if you place the template over the right side of the appointment, the resulting time cockpit will inherit the description, location and duration of the underlying outlook appointment. Read more in the [docs](~/doc/timesheet-calendar/timesheet-templates.md).
