### Improvements for Mobile Devices

We've been listening to your feedback, and so we've made significant improvements to the mobile experience of time cockpit, making it much more user-friendly on devices like tablets and phones. You can now easily access and interact with the time sheet calendar on the go. We've also improved the handling of time cockpit lists. Stay tuned for more improvements.

### Configurable Column Layout

We are pleased to introduce a new way to customize your time cockpit experience. With profiles, you have the flexibility to adjust list views to align with your unique workflow tailoring columns, sorting, grouping, and more to your preferences.

### Formatting Profiles in the Web Client

With the latest updates to time cockpit, we've migrated a convenient feature from the full client that allows you to configure formatting profiles directly within the web client. Now, you have the flexibility to fine-tune your formatting preferences for a more personalized and efficient experience. Read more in the [docs](~/doc/timesheet-calendar/formatting-profiles.md).

### Timesheet Template Improvements

Our time sheet templates now offer enhanced convenience. Dragging a template onto an Outlook appointment will seamlessly adjust its start and end times. Also, dragging a template to the right of an appointment copies relevant information into the new time sheet entry. For signal tracker users, templates snap to fit Outlook appointments when dropped on a signal data bar, streamlining time tracking. Read more in the [docs](~/doc/timesheet-calendar/timesheet-templates.md).

### Print Time Reports

Users can now conveniently generate time reports in PDF or Excel format for a specified time period. This feature is particularly useful for users who need to generate time reports for multiple individuals, especially at the end of the month. Read more in the [docs](~/doc/employee-time-tracking/time-report.md).
