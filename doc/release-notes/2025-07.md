### âœ¨ Improvements

- **Context Menu on Group Logos in Lists**  
  Right-clicking a group logo in a list now opens the same context menu as right-clicking the group itself. This improves usability and aligns behavior across UI elements.

- **New URL for AbsenceTimeCalendar**  
  A second route has been added for the Absence Time Calendar: `/app/absence-time-calendar`. This supplements the existing vacation calendar route and follows consistent lowercase URL naming conventions.

### ðŸ›  Bug Fixes

- **ManyToManyRelationCell: Condition Not Working**  
  Fixed an issue where conditions in `ManyToManyRelationCell` were not evaluated correctly. This affected embedded forms such as "Line of Business Unit" in the administration area.
