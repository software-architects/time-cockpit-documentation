## Web Client

We are currently working on the integration of time cockpit with [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). There is will be no need for a dedicated time cockpit user account anymore. When your time cockpit account is connected with your AAD instance, users will be able to access time cockpit without entering username and password each time they want to access time cockpit. **This feature will only be available in the Web Client.**

## Bug Fixes & Improvements
* When being impersonated and clicking a hyperlink with Strg + F5 the web client crashed.
* In editable lists, when an `Content` attribute in an `ActionCell` contained a condition, the session of the web client timed out.
