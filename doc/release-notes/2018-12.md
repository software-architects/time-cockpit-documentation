## Web Client

### Azure Active Directory

We are currently working on the integration of time cockpit with [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). When your time cockpit account is connected with your AAD, your employees will be able to access time cockpit without entering username and password each time they want to access time cockpit. Currently, we are testing the feature with a friendly customer. We expect to put in in production within the first quarter of 2019. 

**This feature will only be available in the web client.**

## Bug Fixes & Improvements
* When being impersonated and clicking a hyperlink with Strg + F5 the web client crashed.
* In editable lists, when the `Content` attribute in an `ActionCell` contained a condition, the session of the web client timed out.
