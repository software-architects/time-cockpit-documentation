## Performance of Editable Lists

The performance for editable lists has been improved in the new version. Nevertheless, please use as few input contols as possible by limiting the number of editable columns and by limiting the number of rows by filters.

## Bug Fixes in HTML5 Client

- Resize behavior of time sheet entries in calendar at the end of day has been fixed
- In duration picker the day is not changed when 00:00 is entered for end time
- Use script source in lists if defined even if TCQL is defined
- Empty sections in menu are hidden
- Use defined form width
