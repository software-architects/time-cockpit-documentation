## ðŸ›  Bug Fixes

- **DatePicker in Timesheet Calendar**  
  Fixed an issue with the date picker in the timesheet calendar module when navigating to a specific date in the past.

- **Line Breaks in ListView Columns**  
  Line breaks using `\n` are now correctly rendered within ListView column cells.

- **BulletGraphCell Column Width**  
  The column width of the BulletGraphCell is now respected and can be adjusted via the UI.

- **Collapsed Columns in BackReferenceCell**  
  Fixed an issue where columns were incorrectly collapsed to width 0 when opening a BackReferenceCell.

- **Missing Relation on New Entry in BackReferenceTab**  
  When creating a new entry in a `BackReferenceTab`, the relation defined via the `BackReference` property was not automatically set.  
  This is now aligned with the behavior of the `BackReferenceCell`, where the relation is correctly assigned.
