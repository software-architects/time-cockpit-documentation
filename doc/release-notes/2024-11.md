## Bug Fixes & Minor Improvements

- **PWA**: Support for tabs when using [time cockpit as a Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://docs.timecockpit.com/doc/getting-started/web-client.html#use-time-cockpit-as-progressive-web-app-pwa) to enhance navigation and multitasking.
- **Drag & copy**: Enable moving or copying of time sheet entries onto signal bars to easily adjust entry durations.
- **Insert time sheet entry**: Inserting a time sheet entry from the taskbar or with CTRL + I now considers selected signals in the signal area, automatically adjusting start and end times based on signal data.
- **Enhanced footer**: Displays not only the total duration of selected time sheet entries but also the duration of any selected signals from the signal area.
- **User switch**: A "Select Me" link is now available in the time sheet calendar, allowing users to quickly switch back to their own view after selecting another user.
- **Importer update**: The importer now supports importing multiple files simultaneously.
- **File system signal support**: The signal area now also displays signals from the file system, expanding tracking options.
