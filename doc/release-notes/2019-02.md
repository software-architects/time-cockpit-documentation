## Bug Fixes & Improvements

* When there were template queries in time sheet calendar that produce an error, no new time sheet entries could be created. Now, the error is shown below the template booking area and it is still possible to create new time sheet entries.
* Vacation, sick leave and compensatory time are translated in calendar by model entity friendly names.
* When creating time sheet entries via double clicking on a template, the start time is automatically set to the end time of the last time sheet entry of the selected day.
* Filter conditions could not be passed to lists with script sources.
