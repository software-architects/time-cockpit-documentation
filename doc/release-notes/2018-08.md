## Web Client

### Search in Combo Boxes

It is now possible to search in combo boxes for multiple parts by separating them by space. Searching for 'sales prostore' will find 'Sales ProStore' but also 'ProStore.Sales' or 'ProStore.CRM (Sales)'.

## Bug Fixes

- Last row in lists was not always displayed completely
- Office 365 integration now also works in DEV and PREVIEW environment ([read more about DEV and PREVIEW environments](http://www.timecockpit.com/blog/2017/05/09/Change-to-Our-Release-Cycle))
